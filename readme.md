zkDoctor is revolutionizing the healthcare and insurance landscape by integrating cutting-edge technologies like blockchain and machine learning to prioritize user privacy and provide personalized services.

1. Health Diagnostics Models Website: Our platform offers an extensive list of health diagnostic models tailored to meet a wide range of medical needs. Users can assess their health status in real-time and then seamlessly purchase an insurance policy that matches their health profile.
2. Client-Side Model Runner: With zkDoctor, you don't have to worry about exposing sensitive medical data. Our client-side model runner allows users to get their diagnostics and generate zero-knowledge proofs. This means your data stays on your device and is never exposed, ensuring complete privacy.
3. Blockchain-Powered Smart Contracts: We leverage Ethereum smart contracts for on-chain proof verification and tracing of insurance policies. Once a zero-knowledge proof is verified on-chain, the user can proceed to purchase an insurance policy, knowing that their private health information remains confidential.
4. MetaMask Snap Integration: Our custom MetaMask snap offers insurance policy transaction insights. We've also implemented a recurring cron job that keeps you updated on the status of your policy, reminding you when it's time to renew.

By bringing together blockchain's transparency and the privacy features of zero-knowledge proofs, zkDoctor is setting new standards in the healthcare industry, making it safer, more private, and more efficient.
